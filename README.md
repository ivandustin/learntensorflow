# Learn TensorFlow 2

TensorFlow is an infrastructure layer for differentiable programming. At its heart, it's a framework for manipulating N-dimensional arrays (tensors), much like NumPy.

However, there are three key differences between NumPy and TensorFlow:

1. TensorFlow can leverage hardware accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs.
1. TensorFlow can automatically compute the gradient of arbitrary differentiable tensor expressions.
1. TensorFlow computation can be distributed to large numbers of devices on a single machine, and large number of machines (potentially with multiple devices each).
